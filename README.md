# Recurse Center (RC)

This is my repo for the [Recurse Center (RC)](https://www.recurse.com/) interview tasks.

# Tic Tac Toe
Classic game where two players play to get three in a row in order to win the game.

# Reason
In order to apply for Recurse and the admissions process one need to create one of the following:

* Tic Tac Toe game
* Lisp parser
* Space Invaders
* Database server
* Symbolic differentiator
* Your own project

Normally I would choose my own project or build a Database server. But I figured why not step out from my comfort zone and try something new.
Perhaps one day I might attend to the Recurse Center (RC).
